# Next Steps: Training Your ML Trading Model

Now that you have all the components in place, here's how to proceed with training and evaluating your ML trading model:

## 1. Collect Historical Data

First, make sure you have enough historical data:

```bash
# Activate your environment
conda activate ML-torch

# Run the data collection for historical data (at least 90 days recommended)
python src/data/collectors/sol_data_collector.py --historical --days 90
```

This will populate your database with sufficient historical data for training.

## 2. Run Basic Model Training

Start with basic model training to ensure everything works:

```bash
# Run the basic training script
python scripts/train_model.py --data-days 30 --epochs 10
```

This will:
- Fetch 30 days of historical data
- Calculate technical indicators
- Train a model for 10 epochs
- Save the model and metrics to the models/trained directory

## 3. Examine Results

Check the output files in the models/trained directory:
- Look at the metrics JSON file to see performance
- Check the loss curve to verify training convergence

## 4. Run Walk-Forward Optimization

For more robust results:

```bash
# Run walk-forward optimization
python scripts/train_model_walkforward.py --data-days 90 --window-size 20 --test-size 5
```

This uses a more realistic testing approach that better represents actual trading conditions.

## 5. Visualize Model Performance

Launch the dashboard to visualize your results:

```bash
# Install dashboard requirements
pip install -r scripts/dashboard/requirements-dashboard.txt

# Run the dashboard
python scripts/dashboard/model_dashboard.py
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser to see the performance metrics.

## 6. Experiment and Improve

Based on the performance metrics, experiment with:

1. **Different Technical Indicators**: Add or modify indicators in `technical_indicators.py`
2. **Model Architecture**: Adjust the Lorentzian Classifier architecture in `lorentzian_classifier.py`
3. **Signal Generation**: Change the signal thresholds in `train_model.py`
4. **Training Parameters**: Try different learning rates, batch sizes, or epochs

## 7. Deploy the Best Model

Once you have a model with satisfactory metrics:

1. Save the model configuration
2. Implement a real-time inference script
3. Set up a paper trading system to validate performance

## 8. Monitor and Adjust

- Regularly retrain your model as new data becomes available
- Monitor performance metrics over time
- Adjust parameters based on changing market conditions

Remember to optimize for risk-adjusted metrics like Sharpe Ratio rather than just total returns. This will lead to more sustainable trading performance in various market conditions.
