# Solana (SOL) Trading Strategy Development Summary

## Current Status

As of September 15, 2025, we have been working on developing and optimizing trading strategies specifically for Solana (SOL), which is known for its high volatility and large price swings ($30-$100).

### Implemented Strategies

1. **Lorentzian Classifier**
   - Current performance: -80.07% return with 43.9% win rate
   - Uses machine learning to identify patterns in price action
   - Not performing well with current parameters

2. **SOL Volatility Strategy**
   - Uses ATR (Average True Range) to measure volatility
   - Trades breakouts from consolidation periods
   - Implements conservative risk management (2x leverage, 15% allocation, 2% stop loss)
   - Preliminary testing shows promise but needs further tuning

3. **Simple Strategies Collection**
   - SMA Crossover: Uses moving average crossovers with volatility filters
   - RSI Oscillator: Trades oversold/overbought conditions with trend filters
   - Volatility Breakout: Trades breakouts from price channels adjusted by ATR

### Data Pipeline

- Successfully consolidated SOL data from Binance for the last 30 days
- Using 5-minute timeframe for backtesting
- Data stored in CSV format for efficient access

## Challenges and Observations

1. **High Volatility**
   - SOL's large price swings make it difficult to optimize for both uptrends and downtrends
   - Stop losses are frequently hit due to volatility
   - Need to balance between capturing trends and avoiding whipsaws

2. **Parameter Sensitivity**
   - Small changes in parameters can lead to large performance differences
   - Need more robust parameter optimization approach

3. **Risk Management**
   - Lower leverage (2x) seems more appropriate for SOL than higher leverage
   - Position sizing needs to be adjusted based on current volatility

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tune Strategy Parameters**
   - Optimize ATR period and multiplier for volatility detection
   - Adjust consolidation detection parameters
   - Test different stop loss and take profit levels

2. **Improve Signal Quality**
   - Implement better filters to reduce false signals
   - Add trend detection to avoid trading against strong trends
   - Consider combining multiple signals for confirmation

3. **Enhance Risk Management**
   - Implement dynamic position sizing based on volatility
   - Test trailing stops for capturing more profit in strong trends
   - Consider time-based exits for trades that don't move

4. **Evaluate Long-term Performance**
   - Backtest over longer periods to ensure robustness
   - Test performance in different market conditions

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a parameter grid search for the volatility strategy
2. Test different combinations of ATR periods, consolidation thresholds, and breakout levels
3. Implement the best performing parameter set
4. Add additional filters to improve signal quality
5. Test the improved strategy on out-of-sample data

## Performance Goals

- Target win rate: >50%
- Target annual return: >100%
- Maximum drawdown: <20%
- Sharpe ratio: >1.5

By focusing on SOL's unique volatility characteristics and implementing proper risk management, we aim to develop a strategy that can consistently profit from SOL's price movements while managing downside risk.
