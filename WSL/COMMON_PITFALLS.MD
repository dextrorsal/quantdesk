# WSL2 Collaboration Guide for QuantDesk

**Complete guide to understanding WSL2, potential challenges, and best practices for Windows users collaborating on QuantDesk**

---

## üéØ What WSL2 Actually Is

WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) is **NOT** a separate operating system. Here's what it actually does:

### The Reality
- **You stay on Windows** - No dual boot, no separate OS
- **Ubuntu runs in a lightweight VM** - But it's integrated seamlessly
- **You use Windows for daily tasks** - Browsing, email, Office, games, etc.
- **The terminal runs Linux commands** - Full Linux command-line experience
- **Linux dependencies run natively** - Node.js, npm, git, docker, etc.
- **Files are accessible from both systems** - But with performance implications

### How It Actually Works

```bash
# Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt
wsl  # Opens Ubuntu terminal (but you're still on Windows)

# Now you're in Ubuntu (but still on Windows)
cd ~/quantdesk
npm install
./start-all-services.sh

# You can still Alt+Tab back to Windows apps
# Ubuntu runs in the background
```

### What You'll See
- **Windows desktop** - Your normal Windows environment
- **Ubuntu terminal** - Linux command line when you need it
- **File Explorer** - Can access both Windows and Linux files
- **Cursor IDE** - Connected to WSL for development
- **Docker Desktop** - Running containers in WSL

## üö® Major Challenges You'll Face

### 1. File System Performance Issues

**The Problem:**
- Working in Windows folders from WSL is **extremely slow** (10-50x slower)
- File operations become a bottleneck
- npm installs take forever
- Build processes crawl

**Why This Happens:**
- WSL2 uses a virtual filesystem for Windows drives
- Every file operation goes through multiple layers
- Network filesystem overhead

**The Solution:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS work in WSL filesystem
cd ~/quantdesk  # This is fast

# ‚ùå NEVER work in Windows filesystem from WSL
cd /mnt/c/Users/username/Desktop/quantdesk  # This is slow
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Development becomes frustratingly slow
- npm installs take 10+ minutes instead of 1-2 minutes
- File watching and hot reload break
- Team productivity drops significantly

### 2. Port Conflicts and Network Issues

**The Problem:**
- Windows apps may use the same ports as your services
- Services fail to start with "port already in use" errors
- Localhost connections don't work as expected

**Common Port Conflicts:**
- Port 3000: Admin dashboard vs Windows services
- Port 3001: Backend vs other Node.js apps
- Port 5173: Frontend vs development servers
- Port 5432: PostgreSQL vs other databases
- Port 6379: Redis vs other Redis instances

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check what's using a port
sudo lsof -i :3000
sudo lsof -i :3001
sudo lsof -i :5173

# Kill processes if needed
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Use different ports in .env
BACKEND_PORT=3002
FRONTEND_PORT=5174
ADMIN_PORT=3001
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Services won't start
- Development workflow breaks
- Time wasted debugging port issues

### 3. Docker Integration Complexity

**The Problem:**
- Docker Desktop must be properly configured for WSL2
- Containers may not start or communicate properly
- Volume mounts may not work

**Configuration Requirements:**
1. Docker Desktop installed on Windows
2. WSL2 integration enabled
3. Ubuntu-24.04 specifically enabled
4. Proper resource allocation

**Common Issues:**
```bash
# Docker not found
docker: command not found

# Docker daemon not running
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon

# Permission denied
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker --version
docker run hello-world

# Fix permissions
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in

# Check WSL integration
docker context ls
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Database and Redis containers won't run
- QuantDesk services can't start
- Development environment incomplete

### 4. Git Line Ending Nightmares

**The Problem:**
- Windows uses CRLF (\r\n) line endings
- Linux uses LF (\n) line endings
- Git gets confused between systems
- Build processes fail

**Symptoms:**
```bash
# Git shows every line as changed
git diff
# Shows: ^M characters
# Build errors about line endings
```

**The Solution:**
```bash
# Configure Git for WSL (included in setup)
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.eol lf

# Fix existing files
git add --renormalize .
git commit -m "Fix line endings"
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Git diffs are unreadable
- Build processes fail
- Code reviews become difficult
- Team collaboration suffers

### 5. Path Differences and Script Failures

**The Problem:**
- Windows paths use backslashes: `C:\Users\username\project`
- Linux paths use forward slashes: `/home/username/project`
- Scripts and configs break with wrong paths

**Common Issues:**
```bash
# Scripts fail with path errors
./start-all-services.sh: line 15: /mnt/c/Users/username/quantdesk: No such file or directory

# Environment variables with wrong paths
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/quantdesk
# But the database is in a different location
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Always use Linux paths in WSL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/quantdesk"

# Use relative paths in scripts
cd ~/quantdesk
./start-all-services.sh

# Check current directory
pwd  # Should show /home/username/quantdesk
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Scripts fail to execute
- Services can't find configuration files
- Development workflow breaks

### 6. Permission Issues

**The Problem:**
- File permissions differ between Windows and Linux
- Scripts may not be executable
- Files may not be readable/writable

**Common Issues:**
```bash
# Script not executable
bash: ./start-all-services.sh: Permission denied

# Files not writable
npm ERR! EACCES: permission denied, open '/home/username/quantdesk/package-lock.json'

# Directory not accessible
cd: permission denied: /mnt/c/Users/username/quantdesk
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/quantdesk
chmod -R 755 ~/quantdesk

# Fix npm permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Scripts won't run
- npm operations fail
- Development tools break

### 7. Environment Variables Don't Carry Over

**The Problem:**
- Windows environment variables don't exist in WSL
- Applications can't find required configuration
- Services fail to start

**Common Issues:**
```bash
# Environment variable not set
Error: DATABASE_URL is not defined

# Service can't find config
Error: Cannot connect to database

# API keys missing
Error: JWT_SECRET is required
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Set in WSL shell
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/quantdesk"

# Add to .bashrc for persistence
echo 'export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/quantdesk"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Use .env files (recommended)
cp env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit with your values
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- Services won't start
- Applications crash
- Development environment incomplete

### 8. Cursor IDE Integration Issues

# Different npm versions
You: npm v10.2.3
Her: npm v9.6.7

# Different package versions
You: react@18.2.0
Her: react@17.0.2
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use .nvmrc for Node.js version
echo "20" > .nvmrc
nvm use

# Use package-lock.json for exact versions
npm ci  # Instead of npm install

# Use validation script to check versions
./test-wsl-setup.sh
```

**Impact if Ignored:**
- "Works on my machine" issues
- Inconsistent behavior
- Debugging becomes difficult

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Comprehensive Validation and Testing

**Use the Validation Script:**
```bash
cd ~/quantdesk/WSL
./test-wsl-setup.sh  # Checks everything

# Save output for debugging
./test-wsl-setup.sh > debug.txt
# Share debug.txt with team for help
```

**What the Validation Script Checks:**
- WSL version and Ubuntu version
- Node.js and npm versions
- Docker installation and configuration
- Git configuration
- Project structure and dependencies
- Service health endpoints
- File permissions
- Environment variables

### 2. File System Best Practices

**Always Work in WSL Filesystem:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - work in WSL filesystem (fast)
cd ~/quantdesk
npm install
./start-all-services.sh

# ‚ùå Bad - working in Windows filesystem (slow)
cd /mnt/c/Users/username/Desktop/quantdesk
npm install  # Takes 10+ minutes instead of 1-2 minutes
```

**Why This Matters:**
- WSL filesystem: Native Linux performance
- Windows filesystem: 10-50x slower through virtual filesystem
- File watching and hot reload work properly
- npm installs are fast and reliable

### 3. Standardized Service Management

**Use the Provided Scripts:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Use these scripts consistently
./quick-start.sh    # Start all services
./quick-stop.sh     # Stop all services
./health-check.sh   # Check if everything works

# ‚úÖ Check individual services
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Backend
curl http://localhost:5173         # Frontend
curl http://localhost:3000         # Admin dashboard
```

**Service Management Best Practices:**
- Always use the same startup order
- Check service health before development
- Use consistent port configuration
- Stop services properly to avoid conflicts

### 4. Environment Standardization

**Use Consistent Environment Variables:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Everyone uses the same .env file
cp env.example .env
