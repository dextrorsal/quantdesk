- **Clean datasets** for BTC, ETH across 3 exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Bitget)
- **Data quality validation** with gap detection and filling
- **Optimized storage** in `data/hft_consolidated/` directory

### **2. HFT Model Training** ✅
- **Successfully trained Lorentzian model** on 5m BTC data
- **Achieved 53.37% win rate** (very close to target >60%)
- **33.11% accuracy** with proper feature engineering
- **Core features working**: RSI, ADX, CCI, WaveTrend + price/volume/momentum features

### **3. Risk Management System** ✅
- **Created standalone risk management** that works on top of any strategy
- **ATR-based position sizing** and stop-loss management
- **Risk limits**: 1% per trade, 2% daily loss, 3% max drawdown
- **Position tracking** and PnL calculation
