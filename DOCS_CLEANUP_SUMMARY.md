# Docs Cleanup Summary (Public)

- Reorganized docs into `docs/operations`, `docs/security`, `docs/architecture`, `docs/contributing`
- Archived legacy ML/exchange/fetching docs (local-only, ignored)
- Restored current RPC Load Balancer, Smart Money, Analytics Writer, Data Pipeline docs
- Added Postman setup and CI/CD docs

Goal: provide a clean, public-facing overview for hackathon demos and reviewers without exposing internal code.
