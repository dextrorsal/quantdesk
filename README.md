---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ 
- Rust 1.80+
- Solana CLI 1.18+
- Anchor Framework 0.30+

### **One-Command Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy complete DEX to devnet
./quick-deploy.sh deploy devnet

# Deploy to testnet
./quick-deploy.sh deploy testnet

# Or run comprehensive tests
./run-tests.sh
```

### **Frontend Development**
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production (✅ TypeScript errors fixed!)
npm run build
```

### **App Routes (Modes)**
- `/pro` → Pro terminal experience (Quantify UI with terminal + bottom taskbar)
- `/lite` → QuantDesk chrome with Quantify Lite content via `LiteRouter` (progressive port)
- `/trading` → Quantify Professional Trading Interface (charts/trading)
- `/trading-old` → Original QuantDesk trading layout (fallback)
- `/quantify-lite-ref` → Hidden route for raw Quantify Lite (for visual parity checks only)

Mode switcher persists selection to `localStorage: quantdesk_ui_mode` and restores on reload. QuantDesk header remains authoritative for Lite. Phantom is auto-registered; `autoConnect` is disabled to avoid console spam.

### **Smart Contract Development**
```bash
# Build smart contracts (✅ Advanced features implemented!)
cd quantdesk-perp-dex
anchor build

# Run automated tests
anchor test
```

**🎉 QuantDesk: Built with ❤️ for the Solana ecosystem**

*Beta: integrating Quantify Pro/Lite; see Known Limitations below.*

### Known Limitations (Beta)
- Vendored Quantify UI lives under `frontend/src/pro/vendor/quantify/` and is excluded from strict TS checks during dev.
- `/lite` currently renders high-fidelity placeholders for some tabs until adapters are wired.
- Ant Design icons are shimmed for dev to prevent missing import errors.
