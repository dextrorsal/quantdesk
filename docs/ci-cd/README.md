## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Setup** (One-time)
```bash
# Configure GitHub secrets
# Go to GitHub repository settings
# Add required secrets (see Quick Reference)

# Make testing scripts executable
chmod +x test-workflows.sh
chmod +x dry-run-test.sh
chmod +x check-workflow-status.sh
```

### 2. **Daily Development**
```bash
# Test workflows before pushing
./test-workflows.sh

# Run local tests
npm run test

# Check code quality
npm run lint

# Build all services
npm run build
```

### 3. **Testing Without Deployment**
```bash
# Method 1: Local testing scripts
./test-workflows.sh
./dry-run-test.sh
./check-workflow-status.sh

# Method 2: Manual workflow dispatch
# Go to GitHub Actions > Select workflow > Run workflow

# Method 3: Pull request testing
git checkout -b test-ci-cd
git push origin test-ci-cd
# Create PR to trigger workflows
```

### 4. **Deployment**
```bash
# Staging deployment
git push origin develop

# Production deployment
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Workflow Syntax Errors** - Use YAML validators
2. **Missing Secrets** - Check GitHub repository settings
3. **Docker Build Failures** - Test Dockerfiles locally
4. **Test Failures** - Run tests locally first
5. **Deployment Failures** - Check platform-specific logs
6. **Security Scan Failures** - Update vulnerable packages
7. **Performance Issues** - Optimize workflows and builds
8. **Environment Issues** - Verify environment configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Validate workflows
./test-workflows.sh

# Check status
./check-workflow-status.sh

# Simulate execution
./dry-run-test.sh

# Test locally
npm run test
npm run lint
docker-compose build
```
