# Integration TODO List

## Phase 1: Project Structure & Environment âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Unified Project Structure**: Merge `d3x7-algo` and `ml-model` into a single project structure.
- [x] Set up a unified Python environment (requirements.txt or environment.yml)
- [x] Move SupabaseAdapter to a shared/common directory for both projects
- [x] Test that both codebases can import and use the shared SupabaseAdapter

## Phase 2: Data Fetching Interface âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Unified Data Fetching**: Created `UltimateDataFetcher` and `ReliableDataFetcher` with CCXT support
- [x] **Multiple Exchange Support**: Binance, Coinbase, Bitget integration working
- [x] **Database Integration**: Created `DatabaseLoader` for easy data access
- [x] **Fast Data Pipeline**: 885,391 candles fetched from reliable sources (Binance/Coinbase)

## Phase 3: Data Storage âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Supabase/Neon Database**: Professional schema with exchanges, markets, candles tables
- [x] **Database Schema**: Proper relationships, indexes, and views for performance
- [x] **Data Quality**: 1 year of historical data, multiple timeframes, multiple symbols
- [x] **Database Guide**: Complete documentation in `docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md`

## Phase 4: Model Integration âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Model Comparison**: Lorentzian Classifier (53.5% win rate), Chandelier Exit, Logistic Regression
- [x] **GPU Integration**: AMD ROCm PyTorch working perfectly
- [x] **Model Performance**: Best strategy meets user targets (win rate > 50%, drawdown < 5%)
- [x] **Database Loading**: Models can now load data from database instead of CSV

## Phase 5: Live Trading & Metrics ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **Bitget Trading API**: Implement order execution (market/limit orders, position management)
- [ ] **Paper Trading Mode**: Test trading logic without real money
- [ ] **Real-time Metrics**: PnL calculation, position monitoring, asset overview
- [ ] **Trading Dashboard**: Live monitoring interface

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [x] **Historical Data**: 885,391 candles successfully fetched and stored
- [x] **Model Backtesting**: All strategies tested and compared
- [x] **Database Validation**: Schema, indexes, and data integrity confirmed
- [ ] **Live Trading Tests**: Paper trading validation
- [ ] **Multi-exchange Tests**: Ensure redundancy across exchanges

## Phase 7: Documentation & Maintenance ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [x] **Database Guide**: Complete guide for database usage
- [x] **Agent Handoff**: Comprehensive summary for next agents
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Trading API usage and examples
- [ ] **Deployment Guide**: Production deployment instructions
