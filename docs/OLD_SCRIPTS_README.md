# ðŸ“œ Scripts

This directory contains executable scripts for training, deployment, and maintenance.

*For current scripts and usage, see [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md).*

## Directory Structure

### ðŸ“Š Training
Scripts for model training and evaluation:
- [`train_pattern_recognition.py`](../scripts/training/train_pattern_recognition.py): Train the pattern recognition model
- [`data_pipeline_example.py`](../scripts/training/data_pipeline_example.py): Example of using the data pipeline

### ðŸš€ Deployment
Scripts for deployment and monitoring:
- [`monitor_gpu.py`](../scripts/deployment/monitor_gpu.py): Monitor GPU usage during training/inference
- [`check_gpu.py`](../scripts/deployment/check_gpu.py): Verify GPU setup and compatibility

## Usage

### Training Scripts
