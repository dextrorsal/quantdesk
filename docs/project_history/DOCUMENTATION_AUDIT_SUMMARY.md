## üéØ Summary

**The core project documentation is excellent and current.** The main files (README, TODO, Project Overview, Database Guide, Agent Handoff) provide a complete picture of the project status and next steps.

**Recommendation**: Focus on the next development priorities rather than updating the remaining documentation files. The current documentation is sufficient for development and handoff purposes.

**Status**: Documentation audit complete. Core files updated and current. Ready to proceed with development priorities.
