### 1. Updated Existing Documentation
- **[README.md](../README.md)**: 
  - Added a Testing section highlighting our comprehensive testing infrastructure
  - Added link to the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) in the Documentation section
  - Updated Completed Features to include data testing

- **[tests/data/README.md](../tests/data/README.md)**:
  - Enhanced Troubleshooting section with specific WebSocket connection solutions
  - Added detailed instructions for addressing database permission errors
  - Included more specific API troubleshooting tips

- **[docs/NEON_PIPELINE.md](NEON_PIPELINE.md)**:
  - Added a new section on WebSocket Connection Management
  - Included detailed examples of ping/pong implementation for Binance WebSockets
  - Added reconnection logic examples with exponential backoff

### 2. New Documentation
- **[docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**:
  - Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:
    - Database issues and PostgreSQL permission errors
    - Binance API rate limiting and connection problems
    - WebSocket connection issues and proper ping/pong handling
    - Python library dependencies and asyncio patterns
    - Data quality validation and monitoring

## üìù Documentation Changes Purpose

These documentation improvements address several key objectives:

1. **Enhance System Reliability**: Proper WebSocket implementation guidance ensures reliable data collection
2. **Simplify Troubleshooting**: Clear, actionable steps for common issues save development time
3. **Improve Onboarding**: New contributors can quickly understand and work with the system
4. **Document Best Practices**: Proper async patterns and error handling examples demonstrate best practices
5. **Standardize Processes**: Consistent approaches to common tasks like database connection

## üîú Next Steps

Potential areas for future documentation improvements:

1. Add diagrams showing the data flow through WebSockets to database
2. Create a deployment guide for production environments
3. Add performance tuning documentation for high-volume data collection
4. Document ML model integration with the data pipeline
